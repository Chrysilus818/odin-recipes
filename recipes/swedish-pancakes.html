                <ol>
                     <li>Beat eggs in a bowl with mixer until thick and lemon colored, usually 3 to 
                            5 minutes.  Stir in milk.</li>
                    <li>Sift flour, sugar, and salt together in a bowl.  Add to egg mixture; mix until batter

                            and spread to make thin pancackes.  Cook until light brown on bottom, usually 1 to 2 minutes.
